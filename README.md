# Abstract

# Introduciton and Background

The controversy surrounding guns has become a hotbed for political discourse in recent years. Some have linked gun ownership to increases in homicides, suicides, and organized criminal activity (Miller et. al, 2002). A 2004 publication found that owning a gun makes a person three to five times more likely to die by violence (Zimring). Others have suggested that gun ownership does not lead to a net increase in crime but rather increased crime leads to more gun ownership. In the case of this argument, authors argued that gun control laws would be ineffective in reducing violent crime (Kleck et. al, 2002). 

In this project, we investigate the relationship between population demographics, various crime rates, and shall carry gun laws across different regions of the United States between 1977-1999. Shall carry gun laws are laws which allow only licensed, trained, and background checked citizens to carry concealed guns in specific states. 


We seek to answer the following questions:

1. What is the effect of shall carry laws on violent crime in the United States?

2. Is this relationship casual?

It is important to note that a key point regarding the theory of causal interference is the factor variable in question should be changeable. In the case of this project, the shall-carry law in effect is a factor which can be implemented or rescinded by law makers making it ideal for this analysis. 

# Conclusion

# Running the Project

The project can be run by cloning the repository into one's R studio. There is no code or data not included within the repository. The loaded packages (best viewed in the main report) must be installed on one's local R studio. An html and pdf version of the report will be avaible for download. The interactive graphs and tables will be static in the pdf version of the report.
